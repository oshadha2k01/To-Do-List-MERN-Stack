## Troubleshooting

- *Cannot connect to MongoDB*: Ensure your MongoDB URI is correct, and check network access if using MongoDB Atlas. For a local instance, ensure it's running on port 27017.
  
- *CORS issues*: If encountering CORS issues, install and configure cors middleware:
    bash
    npm install cors
    
    In server.js:
    js
    const cors = require('cors');
    app.use(cors());
